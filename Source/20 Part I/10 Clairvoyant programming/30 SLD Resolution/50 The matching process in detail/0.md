# Under construction

Calls get matched to methods using a process that is simple but takes some getting used to.  So we'll go through it in some detail now.

## For programmers

If you’ve programmed before, the idea of calling using matching may be a kind of kick in the head.  Variables work very differently than they do in Python.  Whereas in Python, variables get their values either by being parameters that are filled in during a call, or by being updated with assignment statements like `x=x+1`.  In Step, variables more or less only get values through pattern matching.  Moreover, once a variable has a value, you can’t update it.  This turns out to be very useful for certain kinds of programming.

Later, we will introduce other kinds of variables you can update with assignment statements, so you will be able to write `x=x+1`.  But the vast majority of the code you write will work through pattern matching.

The technical name for this matching process is **unification**.  We'll discuss how to implement it in Part II.
