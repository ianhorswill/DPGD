[Step](https://github.com/ianhorswill/Step) is a declarative programming language that's relatively easy to learn.  If you're familiar with [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prolog), it's basically a generalization of Prolog[^1] with a gentler learning curve.  It was developed for interactive narrative but is general-purpose in the sense that you can write any algorithm in it you can write in other languages.  If Prolog is a language for the Chess Club, Step is a language for theater kids.

While teaching the language, we'll focus on [grammars](grammars), its use as a [query language](answering_questions), and [logic programming](logic_programming).  Then in later sections, we'll look at other specialized systems such as planners, but will implement those systems in Step.  In [Part II](part_ii), we'll talk about how to implement Step and the other systems in more traditional languages.

## Notes

[^1]: Step is a generalization of [Prolog](wiki:Prolog)-style logic programming, [SHOP](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~nau/projects/shop/)-style HTN planners, and [definite-clause grammars](wiki:Definite_clause_grammar).  All use the same basic control structure, so they're easy to unify.  And all have been used in commercial games.
