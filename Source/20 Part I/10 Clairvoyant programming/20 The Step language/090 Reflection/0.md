Reflection is the ability for programs to examine themselves.  In Step, this takes the form of predicates to answer questions like:

* Is my argument a task?
* What are the tasks in the program?
* What are the methods of this task?
* Have I called this task so far?

In programming languages, we often distinguish between **static** properties of the program, which examines the text of the program, and what can be determined from it without running it, and **dynamic** analysis, which analyzes the behavior of the program as it runs.

This is mirrored naturally in reflection capabilities.  Static reflection tells you things about the text of the program: what tasks and methods does it have, what calls what, etc.  Dynamic reflection tells you things about the program as it's running: what's running now?  What was run previously?

We'll talk about each of these now, in turn.
