Reflection is the ability for programs to examine themselves.  In Step, this takes the form of predicates that answer questions like:

* Is my argument a task?
* What are the tasks in the program?
* What are the methods of this task?
* Have I called this task so far?

In programming languages, we often distinguish between **static** properties of the program, which are properties of the *text* of the program rather than any particular run of it, and **dynamic** properties, which involve the behavior of the program as it runs.

This is mirrored naturally in reflection capabilities.  Static reflection tells you things about the text of the program: what tasks and methods does it have, what calls what, etc.  Dynamic reflection tells you things about the program as it's running: what's running now?  What was run previously?

We'll talk about each of these now, in turn.
