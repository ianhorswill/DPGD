Programs perform a series of operations, some of which involve choices.  They act as if they can always predict the right choice so that at the end of execution, it's made a set of choices that result in success.[^1]  That path involves running calls, which run methods, which may run more calls, which select more methods, and so on.  Thus far, we've avoided talking about how these different operations happen through time.  That's because much of the time we can ignore it; it's an unnecessary detail to keep track of.

Nevertheless, operations are performed in a specific order.  In particular,

> If a method contains **multiple operations** --- multiple calls, multiple pieces of output, or mixtures of calls and output --- those operations are performed **left-to-right**.  Thus, leftmost operation is done first and the rightmost is last.

That order can matter because each operation can **change the state** of the computer.  It particular, it can change:

* The **output** by printing
* The values of **variables** by matching or using the `set` operation
* The status of special predicates called **fluents**, whose definition can be changed during execution using the `now` operation.

You already know about output.  Now we'll talk about each of the others, in turn.
