*Starflight*  (Binary Systems, 1986) is the first use of context-free grammars I know of in commercial games.  It was an inspiration for both *Dwarf Fortress* and the *Mass Effect* series.  A number of its [design documents](https://github.com/tangentforks/starflight) are available on GitHub, so we can see the definitions they used.  I've included a copy of the grammar design docs in the [side trail for this page](Starflight_design_document).
