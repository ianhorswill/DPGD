Most problems can be described in terms of making a series of choices.  For example, sorting involves a series of choices about how to move items around.  Ideally, you know in advance what the right choice is.  If you're buying a car, you start by doing research and then choose the car based on your research:

> information → decision

Unfortunately, many problems, such as finding one's way in a maze, involve **delayed feedback**.  You first make the decision and then find out later if it was the right decision.  So the order is reversed:

> decision → information

In the absence of advance information, we're left with exploration. We try things, back up, and try other things until we find something that works:

> decision → information → decision → information → ...

Keeping track of what we have and haven't tried, avoiding trying things we don't need to try, and choosing the best next thing to try is a lot of work.  A large chunk of a typical undergraduate AI course is devoted to managing that bookkeeping.[^1]

## Clairvoyance

Programming would be easier if your computer was a Jedi.  You'd tell it the options available, and the force would whisper in its ear which option to choose.  In computer science, this is known as [nondeterministic choice](wiki:Nondeterministic_Programming) and is a useful/good thing.  However, many other things in CS are also referred to as nondeterminism, and all of those are bad.  Moreover, the name fails to communicate its value  So I'll use the tongue-in-cheek term **clairvoyance** in place of nondeterminism.
