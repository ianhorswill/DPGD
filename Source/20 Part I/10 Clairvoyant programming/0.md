All declarative programming systems involve "clairvoyance" in the sense of appearing to guess correct choices.

## Decision-making in computers

When computers  "make decisions" it generally takes the form of something like an `if` statement (don't worry if this is new to you):
```C#
if (condition) {
    // Option 1
} else {
    // Option 2
}
```
The computer tests whether `condition` is true.  If so, it chooses option 1, otherwise option 2.  Nearly all programs have these.  The general pattern here is:

> information → decision

## Delayed feedback

The problem is we must often make decisions *before* we know the right option.  When moving through a maze, we make many left/right/straight decisions before we find out which ones were correct.  So the order is reversed:

> decision → information

In the absence of timely information, we're left with exploration. We try things, back up, and try other things, until we find something that works:

> decision → information → decision → information → ...

Keeping track of what we have and haven't tried, avoiding trying things we don't need to try, and choosing the best next thing to try is a lot of work.  A large chunk of a typical undergraduate AI course -- the chunk referred to as *search* -- is devoted to managing that bookkeeping.

## Clairvoyance

Programming would be easier if your computer was a Jedi.  You'd tell it the options available, and the force would whisper in its ear which option to choose.  In computer science, this is known as *non-deterministic choice* and is a useful/good thing.  However, many other things are also referred to as non-determinism, and all of those are bad.  Moreover, it fails to communicate its appearl.  So I'll use the tongue-in-cheek term **clairvoyance** in place of non-determinism.

Clairvoyant systems behave *as if* they see the future: they always make the right choice, provided there is a right choice to make.  Behind the scenes, the computer still trying things, backing up, and trying other things until it finds something that works.  But these systems allow you to delegate the trial and error process to the computer.

We'll now introduce a range of different declarative formalisms from grammars to logic programming to generative planners.  We'll begin by teaching the [Step](https://github.com/ianhorswill/Step) programming language.  Subsequent sections will discuss specific kinds of clairvoyant systems and illustrate them using versions written in Step.  All examples could be written equally well in logic programming languages such as [Prolog](wiki:Prolog), however, Step has a gentler learning curve and is arguably more general.
