Now we'll discuss how to use different declarative programming technologies, without much attention to how they're implemented under the hood (that will come in [Part II](part_ii)).  We don't assume any significant programming experience, however we include deeper discussions for those with more technical background.

All declarative programming systems involve a technique that I'll call "clairvoyance."  Let's talk about what that means.

## Decision-making in computers

It's common for people to talk about programs making "decisions."[^1] That generally takes the form of something like an `if` statement (don't worry if this is new to you):
```C#
if (condition) {
    // Option 1
} else {
    // Option 2
}
```
The computer tests whether `condition` is true.  If so, it chooses option 1, otherwise option 2.  Nearly all programs have these.  The general pattern here is:

> information → decision

## Delayed feedback

The problem is we often must make decisions *before* we know the right option.  When moving through a maze, we make many left/right/straight decisions before we find out if they were correct.  So the order is reversed:

> decision → information

In the absence of timely information, we're left with exploration. We try things, back up, and try other things, until we find something that works.  However, keeping track of what we have and haven't tried, avoiding trying things we don't need to try, and choosing the best next thing to try is a lot of work.  A large chunk of a typical undergraduate AI course is devoted just to the management of that bookkeeping.

## Clairvoyance

Programming would be easier if your computer was a Jedi.  You'd tell it the options available, and the force would whisper in its ear which option to choose.  In computer science, this is known as *non-deterministic choice* and is a useful/good thing.  However, many other things are referred to as non-determinism, all of which are bad.[^2] Also, it sounds like technobabble and fails to communicate why anyone would think it was a good idea.  So I'll use the tongue-in-cheek term **clairvoyance** in place of non-determinism.

Clairvoyant systems behave *as if* they see the future and always make the right choice.  Behind the scenes, the computer is of course trying things, backing up, and trying other things until it finds something that works.  But these systems allow you to delegate that process to the computer.

## Clairvoyant languages

We'll start by talking about what I'll call **clairvoyant programming**[^2].  Grammars, planners, and logic programming all fall under this rubric.  These languages let you *under-specify* your programs, leaving many choices up to the computer.  The machine behaves as if it always makes the right choice, even though behind the scenes it's trying alternatives until it finds something that works.  Again, the important thing is that you can mostly ignore that process.

## Constraint programming

Then we'll talk about **constraint programming**.  This also involves having the system make a series of decisions and assuming it always guesses right.  However, whereas the systems we talk about under clairvoyant programming feel like programming languages, constraint programs feels more like questions on IQ tests.  Unlike real IQ tests, you just write them; the computer solves them.  Constraint programming is both more and less powerful than clairvoyant programming, and both harder and easier to debug.  We'll explain what we mean by this when we get to it.

## Endnotes

[^1]: Decision-making is necessary to [Turing completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness): the ability for a language or computer to be truly general-purpose.

[^2]: The "good" sense of nondetermininism is sometimes referred to as *angelic* non-determinism to distinguish it from the bad kinds.
