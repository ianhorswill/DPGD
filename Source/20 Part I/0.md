Part I describes how to use different declarative programming technologies, without much attention to how they're implemented under the hood (that will come in [Part II](part_ii)).  We don't assume any significant programming experience, however we include deeper discussions for those with more technical background.

Most of the examples will use the [Step](https://github.com/ianhorswill/Step), an open-source programming language written in C#.  It's easy to include in Unity or Godot projects.  And you can try it interactively in your browser by clicking on any of the Step code fragments in the following pages.  We'll teach you Step as we go along.

Part I is organized based on different kinds of declarative formalisms.  We start with [grammars](grammars), which aren't usually thought of as a declarative language, but technically are.  They're also very useful for anyone who wants to generate or parse text, and so they're extensively used in games.

Having introduced grammars, we'll talk about how the same basic framework can be used for an approximation logical inference.  This is known as [logic programming](logic_programming).  Classical LP is the most commonly used form of declarative programming.

We will then discuss how grammars can be made much more powerful by integrating logic programming into them.  These are known as definite-clause grammars.

Then at some point we'll talk about planning.

Then we'll talk about constraint programming, which is both more and less powerful than classical logic programming, and both harder and easier to debug.  We'll explain what we mean by this when we get to them.
