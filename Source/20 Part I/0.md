We begin with a tour of different kinds of declarative programming and how to use them.  In each case we'll give you a version you can try out interactively in your browser; when you see a box around some code, you can click it to experiment with it in a sandbox.  If you find declarative programming appealing, you can either include the systems here in your games --- they're open source --- or you can read [Part II](part_ii) for a discussion of how to build your own solvers for declarative systems.

## Types of declarative programming

Again, declarative programming is a family of techniques that let you describe how to recognize a solution to a problem rather than having to describe how to generate one.  The different types vary based on how they let you describe problems:

* **Grammars** describe how some type of artifact can be built by repeatedly replacing parts of it with more complex assemblages.  The artifact could be a quest, some text an NPC is speaking, or a plant such as a tree.
* **Constraint programming** involves specifying the problem in terms of a set of variables, their allowable values, and relationships, called constraints, that either must hold or cannot hold between the chosen values of the variables.  For example, given a set of tasks to do for the week, choose what days you're to do them, subject to the constraints that you can only do three tasks a day and some tasks can only be done certain days, or only weekdays.  
* **Planning** involves describing the current state of the world, the desired state of the world, and how different actions change the state of the world.  The solver --- called a planner --- then finds a sequence of actions that will leave the world in the desired state.
* **Clairvoyant programming** is the most general class of techniques.  It essentially lets you provide an arbitrary program to say "yes, this is what I want" or "no, not this."  The name for this in the academic literature is *nondeterministic* programming, but for reasons that will become clear in a moment, we'll refer to it as clairvoyant programming.

Generally speaking, the techniques early in the list are the most limited in the kinds of problems they can describe; grammars are very restrictive, whereas clairvoyant programming can be used to decribe any problem.[^1]  On the other hand, the more narrow techniques, such as constraint programming, can take advantage of specialized solvers that can be very efficient. 

## Choice

Under the hood, all these techniques involve making a series of choices from prescribed options and recognizing when combinations of choices don't work.  The solver's job is to find a combination of choices that works.  For some types of declarative programming, the choices and the limitations on them are explicit parts of the problem description.  For example, in constraint programming, the choices are the values of the variables and the constraints directly specify how to recognize good and bad combinations.  For other types of systems, such as logic programming, the choices are implicit in structure of the program.
