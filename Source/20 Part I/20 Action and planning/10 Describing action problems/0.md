pagetitle: Describing action problems

Once again, declarative programming is where you describe a problem to the system, without giving it explicit directions for how to solve it, and the system uses a general solver to find the solution.  For action selection, the solvers are typically called action selection systems or planners, but they all take metadata representing the available actions and select an appropriate next action or sequence of actions.

So we should take a moment to discuss what that metadata typically looks like, and the assumptions underlying it.  In particular, we'll assume:
- The world has a set of possible **states**
- Actions have **effects**: they change the world from one state to another
- Actions may have **preconditions** which must be true of the current state to run them

Before talking about different kinds of action selection systems, we'll talk in a little more detail about how we describe action selection problems and why we do it the way we do.
