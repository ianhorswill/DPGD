Building a game requires a vast range of knowledge, from C++ programming to quaternion exponentiation to color theory to writing snappy dialog.  Even starting from a modern game engine, the expertise required is still daunting.  Very few people have the expertise to do everything involved in developing a game.  Even if they did, most games require many person-years of effort.  Very large games can require thousands of person-years.  Human lifespan is wildly insufficient to make *Grand Theft Auto V* on oneâ€™s own.

So realistically, most games, even small indie games, are built by diverse groups of specialists.  Not all are programmers, and often only one is a programmer.
