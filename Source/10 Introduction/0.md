Programming is an act of communication.  Most obviously, a program teaches a machine to perform a task.  But also, software design is nearly always a social social endeavor: people work together to make software that solves a needed task.  And so a program is written not only to communicate with the computer but with other developers.  Were that not the case, we would have no need for comments or meaningful variable names.
