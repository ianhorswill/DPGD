pagetitle: The role of math
---
This book will involve a certain amount of math, or to be more precise, formalism.  There will be very little arithmetic and no calculus whatsoever.  But we will use concepts from math to define specifications and algorithms and in some cases to prove why things work (or don’t).  The goal here is clarity, not obscurity.  I promise not to use Greek letters when code or English sentences will work just as well.  We’ll use math for three things.
