Then there are a number of technical issues with declarative programming.  The first is often referred to as uncomputability or undecidability: there are valid specifications for problems for which answers exist, but for which there (provably) can be no algorithm to find those answers.  The first and most famous example of this is Turing’s Halting Problem.  The spec is “given a procedure (program) and an inputs for it, say whether it will ever return if called on those inputs.”  There cannot be a procedure P that implements that spec perfectly, because if there were, you could write another procedure A that called P to ask it whether A was going to terminate, and then did the opposite.  That’s not to say we can’t write heuristic programs that do a pretty good job.  But Quicksort *always* sorts the array.  It doesn’t sort it 90% or 99.999% of the time. It’s perfect.  We provably can never have a perfect program for solving the halting program.
