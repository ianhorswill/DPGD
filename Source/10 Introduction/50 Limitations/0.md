If you have taken a CS theory class, or if you simply have a cynical nature, this might seem to good to be true.  And indeed, there are a number of caveats.  So let’s discuss these at the outset.

The first thing to admit to is that writing a spec can be as hard, or sometimes harder, than writing a program.  Specifications that are precise enough for a computer to understand are by definition formalisms, and the process by which people translate their intuitions and everyday language into those formalisms is can be error prone.  **Declarative programming is still programming**.  Specs are often shorter than the original program, and in many cases that means less effort than writing an algorithm.  That said, we’ve all had the experience of changing a shorter program into a longer one because it’s simply easier to understand.
