pagetitle: Form and content
---
In a sentence, diagram, or any other form of expression, the **form** of the expression is its written, spoken, or otherwise material form:

* Its words and their arrangement for a sentence
* The elements and their connections for a diagram
* The variables and operations for an algebraic expression

By contrast, the **content** is whatever that expression is trying to convey, that is, its meaning.

There are many other distinctions that mean nearly the same thing -- [signified vs. signifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signified_and_signifier), [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax) vs. [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics).  For our purposes, we can treat these as synonymous.
