This chapter presents the philosophical background of some of the other material here.  **You can safely ignore it**.  It's provided here partly because I'm a nerd, and partly because it helps motivate why, for example, words like "extension" keep coming up in logic and set theory and why people thought that was important.

Most of this background consists of distinctions, such as *form* vs. *content* or *sense* vs. *reference* that came out of [analytic philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy) in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly the philosophy of language and meaning.
