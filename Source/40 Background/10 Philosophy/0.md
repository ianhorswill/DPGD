This chapter presents the philosophical background of the logic, mathematics, and language theory used in the book.  **You can safely ignore it**.  It's provided here partly because I'm a nerd, and partly because it helps motivate why, for example, words like *extension* are used in logic and set theory and why those concepts matter.

Most of this background comes from 19th and early 20th century [analytic philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy) and [philosophy of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind).
