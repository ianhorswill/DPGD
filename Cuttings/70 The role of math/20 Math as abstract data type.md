pagetitle: Abstract data types for algorithms
---
In computer science, when we describe an algorithm, we often don’t give it in any particular programming language.  Actually writing a program in C requires all kinds of extra details – types, include files, etc. – that the compiler needs but we don’t.  Omitting these details makes it easier to understand.  So CS textbooks and research papers often describe algorithms in a kind of striped-down form known as pseudocode, that ideally includes just enough to be clearly understood, with no distractions.
Another reason for using pseudocode is that if you really write it in C, then you generally have to commit to specific implementation details, such as whether to use quicksort or mergesort, or whether a variable should be an array, singly linked list, or doubly linked list.  When there’s an implementation choice that doesn’t affect the presentation of the algorithm, pseudocode leaves things deliberately vague.  We just say the variable is a “sequence,” leaving it to the implementor to decide a specific data type, and we say “sort the sequence”, leaving it to the implementor to choose a sort algorithm appropriate to the selected data structure.  Rather than specifying a variable is a linear-probed hash table, chained hash tabale, AVL tree or Red/Black tree, we might just say it’s a dictionary and assume the implementor can make an intelligent decision about what concrete data structure to use.
